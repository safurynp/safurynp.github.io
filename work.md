**Engineering Graduate Programme at Rolls-Royce** designed to develop the technical experts, business specialists, or managers at an accelerated pace, resulting in a leadership role.

#### Manufacturing Capability Acquisition
In this manufacturing-based attachement, I worked on two automation projects aiming to introduce new manufacturing capability to Rolls-Royce factories in the "Compressors" business:
* Automated visual inspection of fan blade bond lines using machine learning software.
* Automated polishing of outlet guide vanes using industrial robots.

I led the automated visual inspection project by engaging with relevant stakeholders, drafting the business case, and defining the project scope and plan. I also secured research funding and worked with a research institution to deliver initial viability study for the machine learning technology. This involved processing vast amounts of historical inspection data and drafting sutiable validation strategy for the new system.

For the automated polishing project, I focused primarily on the data & systems aspects of the new capability. I worked across multidisciplinary teams (IT, manufacturing engineers, robotics specialists) to understand IT requirements for the new system and deliver NX Robotics process simulations.

#### High Performance Computing
High Performance Computing at Rolls-Royce underpins the simulation-based design optimisation of the aero engines. The team manages the supercomputers and applications used across the whole business to run bi Computational Fluid Dynamics and Finite Element Analysis simulations.

My project, in this attachment, was to develop automated benchmarking software to verify computational performance of different codes and platforms. The software automated the whole benchmarking process from job setup to data analysis, and enabled detailed investigation of speed, performance, scalability, and physics validity of the simulations. Using developed understanding of HPC and software development, I designed the system architecture and planned for implementation of the project. I then built and tested the sofware, and demonstrated its use by benchmarking Rolls-Royce's existing HPC platforms.

The tools used during the project included Python and its most popular scientific libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, h5py, scikit-learn, bokeh), as well as Message Passing Interface (MPI) - a library of routines used to create parallel programs in C.


#### High Temperature Research Centre
In a small team of engineers, I undertook a Design & Make project at the High Temperature Research Centre, with an aim to develop an experimental method of measuring strain on turbine blades during the investment casting process.

My responsibilities within the team involved:
* Leading the systems engineering activities, ranging from gathering requirements to concept selection.
* Planning and desiging experiments, and analysing data to provide stakeholders with information needed for process improvement.

My first task was to interact with the client and other relevant stakeholders to define and finalise the project and system requirements. I then worked with the team to determine logical system architecture, divide accountabilities, and generate a suitable concept for the strain-measuring system. Having defined the requirements, design of experiments was my main responsibility. This involved specifying design details (geometries tested, location of strain gauges), conducting the experiments (interfacing with lab technicions, monitoring results), and data analysis (processing and analysing large amounts of straing data using MATLAB).

With a team of 4 and short timescales of 13 weeks, the project successfully delivered a fully functional, and easy to use experimental strain-measuring system, together with complete documentation.

#### Future Technologies Group
My main project in this attachment was Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis of a radial compressor impeller with supercritical CO2 (sCO2) as a working fluid. On a side, I also worked on developing a software Patent Analysis Tool aiming to aid Intellectual Property teams with analysing large amount of patents.

The sCO2 project, [co-funded by Innovate UK](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=101982), aimed to rapidly advance the maturinty of sCO2 cycle turbomachinery technology. The biggest challenge was the management of "real gas" effects inside the compressor. My responsibilites were to generating understanding and addressing those issues through:
* Creating suitable thermodynamic models.
* Understanding gas behaviour inside the compressor, investigating its performance and characterising it using CFD simulations.

My work led to a series of important deliverables for the teams, business, and scientific community. I led and delivered aerothermal modelling of the sCO2 compressor, which was one of main Innovate UK deliverables. I generated necessary sCO2 understanding to further mature the technology. Produced compressor performance characteristics underpinned control systems design, stress analysis, and design of experiments. Finally, due to highly innovative nature of my work, I was recommended to become a peer reviewer and provided official peer reviews for sCO2 papers submitted for an [ASME conference](https://event.asme.org/Turbo-Expo).

**An industrial placement at DEM Solutions**, an engineering company whose main product is a Discrete Element Method (DEM) software for bulk material simulations.

DEM Solutions is a software engineering company whose main product is EDEM, the leading Discrete Element Method (DEM) software for simulation of bulk materials. During a total of 9 months I spent with the firm, I was involved in a variety of tasks. My two main projects consisted of producing technical videos for the new company website and delivering a “What is DEM” course. Other tasks involved creating standard physics tests for the company’s software and performing quality assurance.

#### Technical marketing project
Various applications of EDEM were researched to learn what type of content should be presented in the videos. Suitable geometries were then created using a computer-aided design package and simulations were set up and run. Post-processing in EDEM and Excel was performed to visualise the data obtained. Finally, the videos were recorded, edited and presented in an attractive form to ensure the final product is delivered in a professional way. During my work, I was also involved in working with API (Application Programming Interface) to define geometry motion with EDEM-MBD coupling and create custom properties for the particles. Standard C++ scripting was used in EDEM API. The six main educational videos produced included analysis of ore flow through a transfer chute, dump truck unloading, potato harvesting, excavator digging, tablet coating and combine harvester processes.

#### "What is DEM" course
The second main project involved creating a “What is DEM” course in order to help prospective clients understand what DEM is. This involved investigating different aspects of this numerical method as well as planning and organising data in order to effectively present the information. In the end, two documents were produced: a concise but descriptive PDF outlining the principles of the method and PowerPoint slides which were presented as a live webinar and followed by a Q&A session. The PDF slidedoc can be found under this [LINK](https://www.edemsimulation.com/download/ebooks/what-is-dem-ebook.pdf/).

#### Quality assurance and testing
Finally, quality assurance was performed on the EDEM software. Various features of the new releases were tested by setting up and running appropriate complex simulations. Standard physics tests for two contact models were also created and verified on different Windows and Linux machines.

* Working in a professional engineering environment.
* Completing a Solid Edge CAD software training course.
* Becoming familiar with Altair HyperWorks CAE software through a series of tutorials.
