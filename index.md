Hi! I am a graduate of the University of Edinburgh holding a first-class degree in MEng Mechanical Engineering and currently working as a Structural Engineer at [Rolls-Royce]. My current responsibilties involve system design integration and performing computational mechanical analyses.

Within engineering, my biggest interests include **engineering simulation** and **mathematical modelling**, and outside of work I still enjoy [competitive tennis].

This website aims to showcase a variety of [projects] I got involved in over the past few years at universities and in the industry.
