I graduated from the University of Edinburgh in June 2017 with a first-class degree in MEng Mechanical Engineering. While at university, I also had a chance to complete two international exchanges. I visited Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA) in China for a month and studied at the University of Pennsylvania in the USA for a year. Below are some of the interesting projects I completed at those universities.
