One of my projects at Altair EDEM involved creating a “What is DEM” course in order to help prospective clients understand what Discrete Element Method (DEM) is. This involved investigating different aspects of this numerical method as well as planning and organising data in order to effectively present the information. In the end, two documents were produced: a concise but descriptive [PDF eBook](https://www.edemsimulation.com/what-is-dem-ebook-download) outlining the principles of the method and [PowerPoint slides](https://www.edemsimulation.com/webinar/dem-introduction-discrete-element-method/) which were presented as a live webinar and followed by a Q&A session.
