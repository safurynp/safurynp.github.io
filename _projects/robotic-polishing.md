In this manufacturing-based attachement, I worked on two automation projects aiming to introduce new manufacturing capability to Rolls-Royce factories in the "Compressors" business. One focused on automated polishing of outlet guide vanes using industrial robots.

For the automated polishing project, I focused primarily on the data & systems aspects of the new capability. I worked across multidisciplinary teams (IT, manufacturing engineers, robotics specialists) to understand IT requirements for the new system and deliver NX Robotics process simulations.
