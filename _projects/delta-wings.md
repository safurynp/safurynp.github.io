#   The absence of full mobile device support was negatively impacting on
#   Ski Solution's conversions and search engine rankings considerably. The site
#   at the time had a separate mobile site with a stripped down feature-set. The
#   solution was to create a fully redesigned responsive experience and optimise
#   the website from the bottom up to improve SEO and drive enquiries.

#   Working from a mobile first approach, I redesigned the site to work across
#   mobile, tablet and desktop, creating a CSS framework and icon font to maintain
#   consistency with the colours, geometry and component styles.

Delta wings allow for generation of lift forces at very large angles of attack, where conventional high-aspect-ratio wings would stall. Moreover, their shape causes the force variations to be small when the angle of attack is changing in time. For those reasons, delta wings are considered as a suitable submerged hydrofoil for a small marine vehicle. The goal of the project was to model a submerged delta wing to estimate the hydro-dynamic lift and drag coefficients and the flow field around the wing when sailing in head waves. An unsteady vortex structure was observed at the suction surface of the hydrofoil. Detailed convergence uncertainty study was conducted and the results were compared with literature.
