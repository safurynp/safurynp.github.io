In this manufacturing-based attachement, I worked on two automation projects aiming to introduce new manufacturing capability to Rolls-Royce factories in the "Compressors" business. One focused on automated visual inspection of fan blade bond lines using machine learning software.

I led the automated visual inspection project by engaging with relevant stakeholders, drafting the business case, and defining the project scope and plan. I also secured research funding and worked with a research institution to deliver initial viability study for the machine learning technology. This involved processing vast amounts of historical inspection data and drafting sutiable validation strategy for the new system.
