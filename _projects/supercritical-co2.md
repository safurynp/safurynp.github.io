My main project in this attachment was Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis of a radial compressor impeller with supercritical CO2 (sCO2) as a working fluid. On a side, I also worked on developing a software Patent Analysis Tool aiming to aid Intellectual Property teams with analysing large amount of patents.

The sCO2 project, [co-funded by Innovate UK](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=101982), aimed to rapidly advance the maturinty of sCO2 cycle turbomachinery technology. The biggest challenge was the management of "real gas" effects inside the compressor. My responsibilites were to generating understanding and addressing those issues through:
* Creating suitable thermodynamic models.
* Understanding gas behaviour inside the compressor, investigating its performance and characterising it using CFD simulations.

My work led to a series of important deliverables for the teams, business, and scientific community. I led and delivered aerothermal modelling of the sCO2 compressor, which was one of main Innovate UK deliverables. I generated necessary sCO2 understanding to further mature the technology. Produced compressor performance characteristics underpinned control systems design, stress analysis, and design of experiments. Finally, due to highly innovative nature of my work, I was recommended to become a peer reviewer and provided official peer reviews for sCO2 papers submitted for an [ASME conference](https://event.asme.org/Turbo-Expo).
